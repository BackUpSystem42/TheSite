					Welcome to Arco&iacuteris Monocrom&aacutetico. It is Spanish for monochromatic rainbow. You might be curious about what is happening around here or what we do. Arco&iacuteris Monocrom&aacutetico is a solo indie game studio.

				<h3>Why not have “studio” in the name if you are a game studio?</h3>
				<p>
					Well for some of the ideas/projects that I have, I am not 100% sure that a video game will be the best medium to tell the story. Arco&iacuteris Monocrom&aacutetico will be primarily a game studio. There might be some involvement of other media like books or animation. I think it will lose a bit of the mystery in the name if I include studio.

				<h3>Dude, what is with your name?</h3>
				<p>
					There are a few things about the name.
				</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						I propose a list of names to my family and monochrome rainbow stuck. As I was researching to see if the name was taken. Sadly, the domain name monochrome rainbow was taken.  It was suggested to translate it into Spanish. URL with accents are tricky things. One source said it is possible and another said it was not. So, the URL is what it is. Letter with accents are tricky with business names too. I also learned that a monochrome rainbow is a real thing, it is sometime called a red rainbow.
					</li>
					<li class="important">
						
							Any negative implication or perception thereof against any community, group, beliefs, individuals, etc., was not intended in the selection and creation of the name nor is it the stance of the studio. Arco&iacuteris Monocrom&aacutetico is a game studio. The video games and other products are a work of fiction and for entertainment purposes. 
						
					</li>
					<li>
						The initial reason why monochrome rainbow was even considered is that it has a different perspective on something common. I often hear that art is best when it is not restrictive or restricted. You should and can do anything. I disagree. If you are going to make the best cheeseburger, you cannot be a good meatloaf. If you are designing the best speedboat, you cannot be a yacht. If you are making a Rom-Com, you are not making a Thriller. By limiting yourself, you will make something new. The phrase “less is more” is the artist equivalent of saying “I can do it with one arm behind my back”. You do not need to be or have everything to be great.
					</li>
					<li>
						The longer I sit on the name, Acroíris Monocromático. The more I like it. It is an accurate representation of how I think. 
						<ul>
							<li>
								Coloring is stressful for me. As a kid, I look at a box of crayons and dread about it. I either use all the colors, even though I do not need/want to. Or I use just one color. I did not want to waste any crayons. 
							</li>
							<li>
								It also shows how often I accidentally become edgy. I do not mean to, but it happens. I often say something serious or a little depressing, but my intention is not to make things unsettling. Something familiar but off.
