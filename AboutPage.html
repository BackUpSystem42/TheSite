					You can call me Jage (pronounce as Ya-Ge), it is a nickname. I do not have much experience in game design. That does not mean that I have no clue of what I am doing. I have a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering.

				<h3>Why is that relevant?</h3>
				<p>
					Well, pretty much every engineering class I had to do some programing to solve a problem or to generate a graph. It is not just one-off assignments.  I worked in a three-year student work study which involved making a simulation. I was also involved in making a software for a custom-made 3D-printer in my senior project. I was even Undergraduate Student Assistance for computer science. I am often the one programing in a team project.  Each class, I had to use a different language. Some just prefer one over another and it will be easier to grade the work. Others want us to gain some experience with it. I used Python, Mathematica, MATLAB, Labview, Arduino IDE and a few others. (I had to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the first time to make this site). I constantly had to be on my toes. I did not just understand how to use a single programing language. I understand the logic needed to program for a project.

					I also had to model parts in different applications like Fusion, Inventor, and OnShape. I also draw as well. Some of it was done on and by a computer. I did learn to draw parts sketch by hand. Understanding perspective, abstract thinking, and part dependency are a big fundamental in 3d modeling. These skills can easily transfer to modeling character and rigging them.

					Figuring out how to solve a problem often involves reading the manual/official document. As an engineer, half the time is reading to understand a topic to solve a problem. I search to see if there is something that already in existence that meets my need or an example of how a feature works. I often need to make my own function/feature. Even if I have no clue where to go, I look for inspiration. Some of the topics that I look into are not necessarily or seem related to the project. Looking into video game Object-Oriented Programing helped me think and helped me solve some of my problems in my engineering courses.

					I have the skill to find and solve programing problems. It might take me a bit to solve it. A few overnighters, pacing in circles, pulling my hair for a bit, I will be able to find a solution or a reasonable compromise which will meet the goal. I like to think. Problem solving. Making something into reality. I enjoy the art of creation.

					I have an interest in science fiction and fantasy. For both, I do not have the typical interest in them. I do not care for typical fantasy worlds like elves, dwarfs, ogres, angels, etc. I am more intrigued in a unique world with its own law of nature. In science fiction, I do not care about aliens or even ‘futuristic’ technology. I just care about robots like mechs and automatons.
